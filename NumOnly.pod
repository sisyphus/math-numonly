=head1 NAME

  Math::NumOnly - Disallow numeric operations that don't involve an IV or NV

=head1 DESCRIPTION

  This disallowance of numeric operations applies only to operations that
  involve one (or more) Math::NumOnly objects.
  Arithmetic in which none of the operands are Math::NumOnly objects will still
  proceed as per the normal rules.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Math::NumOnly;

  # my $a = Math::NumOnly->new('123.5') # Fatal error - given arg is a string.
  my $a = Math::NumOnly->new(123.5); # $a holds value of 123.5
  my $b = $a + 42; # $b holds value of 165.5
  # $b += '34.5';  # Fatal error - '34.5' is a string
  $b += 34.5;      # $b holds value of 200
  print $b, "\n";  # prints 200

  $pv = '3';
  $iv = $pv + 7; # $iv is an IV, value 10.
  $c = Math::NumOnly($iv); # $c holds value of 10
  #$c += $pv;  # Fatal error - $pv is still recognized as a string.
